# Hatch2020Badge

Thank you for being interested in this year's Hudson Alpha Tech Challenge Badge!!!  

The badges were designed by Andrew Denio and sponsored by Hudson Alpha.  

More information will come after HATCH weekend.  

The badge is in the shape of the Hudson Alpha logo.  It features a fully functioning circuit if you would like to solder components onto the top surface.  Using a 555 timer and a 4017 Decade Counter, the 10 LEDs will flash one by one.  Using the "speed" switch, the user can either pick a slow or fast blinking mode for the LEDs.  

If you have any questions or comments, please initiate an 'Issue' on github and I will answer as soon as I can.
